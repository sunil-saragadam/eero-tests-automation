Sure! Here's a **simplified and cleaner version** of the `README.md`, perfect for a collaborative project where everyone is working on different AP test cases:

# Eero AP Test Automation

This repository is for automating various test cases for Eero Access Points (APs), like:
- SQM (Smart Queue Management)
- ACS (Automatic Channel Selection)
- AP-STA Connectivity
- Security (WPA2, WPA3, etc.)

## 👥 For quick start

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/eero-ap-test-automation.git
cd eero-ap-test-automation
````

### 2. Create a Folder for Your Test

Make a new folder with your test name and add your scripts inside.

Example:

```bash
mkdir sqm
cd sqm
touch test_sqm.py
```

You can name the folder something like `acs`, `security`, `ap_sta`, `beacon`, etc.

### 3. Add a Small README in Your Folder

Inside your test folder, create a `README.md` and describe:

* What the test does
* How to run it
* Any dependencies

### 4. Commit and Push

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<your-test-name>
git add <your-folder-name>
git commit -m "Added <your test name> test"
git push origin feature/<your-test-name>
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub.

## 🔁 Folder Structure Example

```
.
├── sqm/
│   └── test_sqm.py
├── acs/
│   └── acs_test.py
├── ap_sta/
│   └── sta_connect_test.py
├── security/
│   └── wpa3_test.sh
└── README.md
```

## ✅ Notes

* Keep your test code and logs clean.
* Add instructions for others to run your test.
* Coordinate with others to avoid duplication.
